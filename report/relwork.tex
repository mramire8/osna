The current work on social bot detection typically uses network analysis techniques to construct complex features and induce a probabilistic classifier. \cite{} proposed a classifier trained on \fixme{list the features}

The described methods on previous studies rely on available datasets, which are expensive to build. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first attempt to use active learning to build a social bot classifier. Furthermore, it is the first attempt to use an anytime active learning approach to address the task.
