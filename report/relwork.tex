\section{Related Work}

The current work on social bot detection typically uses network analysis techniques to construct complex features and induce a probabilistic classifier. \cite{lee:aaai11} proposed a classifier trained on a variety features such as demographics, friendship network, user content, and user history.  \cite{sriram:sigir10} also proposes the use of alternative natural language processing features from the user's profile. In contrast to our method, we propose to use only the user content under an active learning framework.

Furthermore, he described methods on previous studies rely on available datasets, which are expensive to build. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first attempt to use active learning to build a social bot classifier. However, our work is the first attempt to use an anytime active learning approach to address the task.
