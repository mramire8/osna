\section{Conclusions}

We proposed an active learning method to detect bot operated twitter accounts using a tweet from the users timeline. Identifying the automated nature of an account is a hard problem. We discuss possible alternative to build a training set of bot and human account by using active learning methods. We found that active learning methods can potentially save on annotation cost, however, further reducing the annotation cost by applying anytime active learning methods
